# Sample KiCAD projects

Here are my random sample projects for KiCAD.

Tested under OpenSUSE LEAP 15.2 with this package:

```
rpm -q kicad
kicad-5.1.8-lp152.2.3.1.x86_64
```

## Projects

* `tz1-mvb/` - simple AF multivibrator from TZ1 kit (was
   "tranzistor tester kit 1" sold around '85 in socialism era).
